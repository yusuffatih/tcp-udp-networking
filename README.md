# C Network Programming - TCP/UDP Server-Client

This repository contains simple implementations of TCP and UDP server-client applications written in C. These programs demonstrate basic network communication concepts and are based on the concepts learned from **Beej's Guide to Network Programming in C**.

## Project Structure

- **notes.c**: A file containing some personal notes and learning from the guide.
- **tcp-server**: Contains a TCP server and client implementation.
- **udp-server**: Contains a UDP server and client implementation.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `tcp-server` or `udp-server` directory.
2. Compile the server and client programs:
   ```bash
   gcc server.c -o server
   gcc client.c -o client
